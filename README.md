# STRUCTURAL-CONDITION-MONITORING-SYSTEM-WITH-NB-LTE BY-USING-ACCELEROMETER-SENSOR.
This project aims to develop a real-time structural condition monitoring system that utilizes an accelerometer sensor to detect vibrations and potential structural anomalies.
The system is equipped with NB-IoT (Narrowband Internet of Things) or LTE-M (Long Term Evolution for Machines) communication technologies, enabling low-power, wide-area (LPWA) wireless data transmission from remote or hard-to-access infrastructure.
The accelerometer sensor captures vibration data, which is processed to identify unusual structural behaviors such as cracks, tilting, or weakening.
This data is then transmitted over NB-IoT/LTE-M to a cloud server or central monitoring system, allowing for remote diagnostics, alerts, and historical data analysis.
The system is particularly suited for monitoring bridges, buildings, towers, dams, and other critical infrastructure, providing early warning of potential structural failure, enhancing public safety, and reducing maintenance costs.

Key Features:
Real-time vibration and movement monitoring using accelerometers
Wireless data transmission via NB-IoT/LTE-M
Low power consumption for long-term deployment
Remote access and cloud-based data visualization
Alerts and notifications on threshold breaches
Scalable system for multiple sensor nodes
